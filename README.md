# Hare Raylib Bindings
- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com)
- [Hare Language](https://harelang.org/)

Project started after [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrqM0Ym_NbK1fqeQG2VIohg) made a video trying out hare and linking it with raylib.
- Here's the video: [Hare Programming Language - Tsoding Daily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E3E_Rh3mvw)
So the rest of these bindings would not have been possible if not for this video.

Bindings were made following the [Hare Style Guide](https://harelang.org/style/). Which means you will see some differences between RaySan5's definition of Raylib functions and types and the functions and types in these bindings. Most notably the use of snake_case for functions and PascalCase for type names.

## TODO
I am basically ticking things off from the raylib cheatsheet page. You can check that page here: [List of implemented bindings](./raylib_cheatsheet.md).
